DeprecationWarning: `np.bool` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.\n","Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def tokens_to_text(self, result_tokens):\n","  shape_checker = ShapeChecker()\n","  shape_checker(result_tokens, ('batch', 't'))\n","  result_text_tokens = self.output_token_string_from_index(result_tokens)\n","  shape_checker(result_text_tokens, ('batch', 't'))\n","\n","  result_text = tf.strings.reduce_join(result_text_tokens,\n","                                       axis=1, separator=' ')\n","  shape_checker(result_text, ('batch'))\n","\n","  result_text = tf.strings.strip(result_text)\n","  shape_checker(result_text, ('batch',))\n","  return result_text"],"metadata":{"id":"1dEmKEDLDNqk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651351012615,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":94,"user":{"displayName":"SADIA NASRIN TISHA","userId":"02263054014606509562"}}},"execution_count":64,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Translator.tokens_to_text = tokens_to_text"],"metadata":{"id":"x7_3o8LBDSID","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651351014134,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":80,"user":{"displayName":"SADIA NASRIN TISHA","userId":"02263054014606509562"}}},"execution_count":65,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["example_output_tokens = tf.random.uniform(\n","    shape=[5, 2], minval=0, dtype=tf.int64,\n","    maxval=output_text_processor.vocabulary_size())\n","translator.tokens_to_text(example_output_tokens).numpy()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1OoQyfhSDWTN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1651351015057,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":120,"user":{"displayName":"SADIA NASRIN TISHA","userId":"02263054014606509562"}},"outputId":"125bdb99-5834-4279-8cc2-5f2a626e018a"},"execution_count":66,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([b'NUMBER (crvd-L)POSS-1p', b'ns-NEW-YORK (1h)DO-DO',\n","       b'fs-ISSUE EACH+ONE-pl-arc', b'LAUGH-HARD REFUSE', b'ALONE MONEY+'],\n","      dtype=object)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":66}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def sample(self, logits, temperature):\n","  shape_checker = ShapeChecker()\n","  #
